# CodeVoice - Microservices Architecture Plan

## üéØ **Project Overview**
Transform CodeVoice into a scalable, production-ready microservices platform demonstrating enterprise-level architecture skills for FAANG interviews.

## üèóÔ∏è **Target Architecture**

### **Core Services**
1. **API Gateway** - Route management, authentication, rate limiting
2. **Speech Service** - Audio transcription (extracted from current backend)
3. **Code Generation Service** - AI-powered code generation (extracted from current backend)
4. **Weather Service** - Real-time weather data and forecasts
5. **Task Management Service** - Calendar integration and task scheduling
6. **User Service** - Authentication, user management, preferences
7. **Notification Service** - Real-time notifications and alerts
8. **Analytics Service** - Usage metrics and performance monitoring

### **Infrastructure Components**
- **Kubernetes** - Container orchestration
- **Docker** - Containerization
- **Redis** - Caching and session management
- **PostgreSQL** - Primary database
- **gRPC** - Inter-service communication
- **Prometheus + Grafana** - Monitoring and observability
- **Nginx** - Load balancing
- **Helm** - Kubernetes package management

## üìã **Implementation Phases**

### **Phase 1: Infrastructure Foundation**
- [ ] Docker containerization for all services
- [ ] Kubernetes manifests and Helm charts
- [ ] CI/CD pipeline setup
- [ ] Basic monitoring with Prometheus/Grafana

### **Phase 2: Service Extraction**
- [ ] Extract Speech Service from current backend
- [ ] Extract Code Generation Service from current backend
- [ ] Create API Gateway service
- [ ] Implement service discovery and communication

### **Phase 3: New Services**
- [ ] Weather Service with OpenWeatherMap API
- [ ] Task Management Service with Google Calendar integration
- [ ] User Service with JWT authentication
- [ ] Notification Service with WebSocket support

### **Phase 4: Advanced Features**
- [ ] Real-time communication with gRPC
- [ ] Advanced caching strategies
- [ ] Auto-scaling based on demand
- [ ] Blue-green deployment strategy

### **Phase 5: Production Readiness**
- [ ] Security hardening
- [ ] Performance optimization
- [ ] Comprehensive testing suite
- [ ] Documentation and runbooks

## üéØ **FAANG Interview Highlights**

### **Technical Skills Demonstrated**
- **System Design**: Microservices architecture, service communication
- **Scalability**: Horizontal scaling, load balancing, caching
- **Reliability**: Health checks, circuit breakers, graceful degradation
- **Observability**: Metrics, logging, tracing, alerting
- **DevOps**: Containerization, orchestration, CI/CD
- **Security**: Authentication, authorization, data protection

### **Business Impact**
- **Cost Optimization**: Auto-scaling reduces infrastructure costs
- **Performance**: Caching and load balancing improve response times
- **Maintainability**: Service isolation enables independent deployments
- **Innovation**: Easy to add new voice assistant skills

## üöÄ **Next Steps**
1. Set up Docker and Kubernetes development environment
2. Extract existing services into separate containers
3. Implement service-to-service communication
4. Add monitoring and observability
5. Deploy to cloud platform (GKE/EKS)
